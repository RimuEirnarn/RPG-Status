ItemHeader:
  Type: Armor
  Wear_at: BodyArmor(0)
Item:
  Name: Debug Headplate
  Description: >
    This is a Debug item and an example item to provide view over how file-structure can be initialized (and hacked).
  Buff:
    Atk: @const:infinity
    Def: @const:infinity
    Accuracy: @const:infinity
    Luck: 42%
    # 42 here is not the same as usual 42. It is a percentage of the actual number.
    # Or perhaps, i should define it differently?
  Debuff:
    # Debuff is same as adding a 'negative' sign to a attribute.
    Agi: 1%

# ItemHeader should have not be defined, as if we're already adding it to something like: armor.head.debug_headplate
# We're slightly mimicing Veloren's object/item structure.

# @<any> and a function like BodyArmor and etc. should be unhackable.
# as if there's nothing feels like a vulnerability...
